## Data Preparation
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy
- Standardized categorical values for better readability (e.g., gender and marital status)
- Created age brackets from raw age values:
  - Adolescent: under 31
  - Middle Age: 31–55
  - Old: above 55

## Analysis & Visualizations
Four pivot-based visualizations were created to analyze:
 Average income by gender and purchase status
 Bike purchases across different age brackets
 Customer commute distance vs purchase behavior
 Overall purchase distribution across key demographics

## Dashboard & Interactivity
The visualizations were combined into a single interactive dashboard.
Slicers were added to allow dynamic filtering by:
- Marital Status
- Occupation
- Education
- Region

These filters enable users to explore trends and compare purchasing behavior across different customer segments.

## Key Insights
- Middle-aged customers accounted for a higher number of bike purchases compared to older age groups.
- Customers with higher average income showed a greater likelihood of purchasing a bike.
- Male customers generally have higher average income than female customers, regardless of purchase status.
- Commute distance influences the bike purchase, moderate commute ranges show higher purchase counts.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts
- Slicers
